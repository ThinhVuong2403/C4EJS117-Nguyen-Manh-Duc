// 1. var and const are variable declarations in JavaScript.

// 2. let is block scoped, "ReferenceError" is displayed when we try to access 
// a variable before it is declared.

// 3. let and const are both block scoped, "ReferenceError" is displayed when we
// try to access a variable before it's declared. However, let variables can be
// re-assigned, while const variables cannot be re-assigned, only the properties
// of the const objects can be mutated.

// 4. var should not be used in any case.
// const should be used when you want to signal a warning to yourself and others
// looking into your code that the variable should not be re-assigned.
// let should be used when you intend to re-assign the variable.
